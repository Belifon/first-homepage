                <h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
                <p>My name is Yelissa Tomic, and I am an occupational physician with a growing interest in computer science and technology. Over the course of my career, I have worked with a variety of companies, providing advice on health and safety, giving seminars and conferences to increase health literacy among employees, participating in business optimization, evaluating workplace chemicals, studying psychosocial hazards and risks, and conducting ergonomic risk analysis. In addition, I have managed health personnel and infirmary teams, conducted medical screenings, and carried out health surveillance.</p>
                <p>As I embark on this new journey in computer science, I am currently taking CS50x from Harvard University, which covers a broad range of topics such as programming in C, Python, JavaScript, and SQL, as well as web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am still new to this field and have much to learn, but I am excited to continue developing my skills and I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow, both in computer science and in my work as an occupational physician. I believe that the intersection of these two fields offers many exciting possibilities, and I am eager to explore them.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my homepage. Please don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">reach out</a> if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations.</p>
